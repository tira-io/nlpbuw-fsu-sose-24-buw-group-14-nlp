# Extractive Summarization

As a part of Assignment-4 we implements an extractive summarization solution for the CNN news dataset using a combination of TF-IDF and TextRank algorithms.

## Folder Structure

- `data/`: Contains the input data files.
- `src/`: Contains the source code for the summarization.
  - `main.py`: The main script to run the summarization.
  - `summarization.py`: The script containing the summarization logic.
  - `utils.py`: Utility functions (if any).
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies required to run the project.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview and instructions for the project.

## Setup

1. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
